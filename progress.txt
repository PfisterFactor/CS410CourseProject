--- CS 410 Progress Report ---


--- Question 1 --- 

We have made a powerpoint prototype of where we want to take the project and how we want the interface to look
We have had an initial meeting to discuss our responsibilities and a more specific timeline for the project.


--- Question 2 ---

We still need to break ground on the code, something that we are hoping to accomplish during or immediately after the break from school.
Then we need to test our functionality, make sure that it is user friendly, and upload the assignment when things are looking good.

--- Question 3 ---

The main challenge we have right now is time management, as we are all fairly busy especially with the holidays being shortly followed by finals.
When we do work together, we are efficient and are confident that the assignment will pick up significant progress soon.
